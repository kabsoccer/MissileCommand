# Missle-Command

This is a simple game made using WebGL rendering functions for my Computer Graphics class at NC State University. Unfortunately, due to access restrictions on the assets used, the game will no longer run.

Render.js is the main file used for the WebGL programming, where you can see my data structures for the objects in the scene and the custom shader functions written.
